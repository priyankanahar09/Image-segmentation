## Introduction

Image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, enabling the identification and delineation of objects within an image. This repository focuses on two key areas:

1. **Aerial Image Segmentation**: Segmenting objects such as buildings, roads, vegetation, and vehicles from aerial images.
2. **Human Segmentation**: Isolating human figures from various backgrounds for applications in augmented reality, surveillance, and more.

## Datasets

### Aerial Image Datasets

## Models

We provide implementations of various segmentation models, including:

- **U-Net**: A convolutional network architecture for fast and precise segmentation.
- **Mask R-CNN**: Extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks.
- **DeepLab**: Employs atrous convolution to segment objects at multiple scales.
