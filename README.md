# Image-segmentation


Welcome to the Aerial Image Segmentation Repository! 

This repository provides tools, datasets, and models for performing image segmentation on aerial imagery, specifically focusing on building and road segmentation using the Massachusetts Building Dataset and Roads Dataset. The goal is to offer a comprehensive resource for researchers and developers working in the field of computer vision.

Image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, enabling the identification and delineation of objects within an image. This repository focuses on:


**Massachusetts Building Dataset**
The Massachusetts Building Dataset contains high-resolution aerial images annotated with building footprints. This dataset is ideal for training and evaluating models for building segmentation tasks.

Dataset Link: [Massachusetts Building Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/)

Description: The dataset includes aerial images and corresponding building annotations in the form of binary masks.
